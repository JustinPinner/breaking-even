# Breaking Even
A present for the Gu

This is the code behind [https://justinpinner.github.io/breaking-even/html/](https://justinpinner.github.io/breaking-even/html/)
for anyone curious enough to want to poke around at the source.

Now that it's all out in the open and above board, and I've even invited David and Kath to play, I figured I could relax 
a bit and share it with you.

It's a bit of a hacked-together thing based on [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) and is probably about as far 
as it's possible to get from a good example of how to create a game with that engine. Or at all, really.

But whatevs - it was fun to throw together and play for a few minutes at a time. And breaking even is hard after all!

Enjoy :)
